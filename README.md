# Obsidian Plugin Comment

Obsidian Plugin Comment is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that allows users to add personal annotations to each installed plugin. This is particularly useful for keeping track of why certain plugins are installed and their specific use cases.

## Features

- Add personal annotations to any installed plugin in the settings pane.
- Annotations are saved persistently and can be edited at any time.
- Annotations are displayed directly below the plugin information.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/alberti42/obsidian-plugin-comment/releases) page.
2. Extract the files into your Obsidian plugins folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-plugin-comment`.
3. Enable the plugin in the "Community plugins" settings pane.

## Usage

1. Open the "Community plugins" settings pane.
2. You will see a text area below each installed plugin where you can add your personal annotation.
3. Annotations are automatically saved and will be displayed whenever you open the settings pane.
